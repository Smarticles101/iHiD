### Bio

I spend my time building organisations and businesses that help others. My core skillset involves strategy, leadership, community building, and software development. I have a degree in Artificial Intelligence and have co-developed a [deep-learning algorithm used in Interventional Cardiology](https://patentscope2.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2019122919&tab=PCTBIBLIO). 

Day-to-day, I'm normally coding, leading, strategising or thinking - whichever is the most important at any given time

Away from work I read, travel, climb, and get nerdy about coffee.
